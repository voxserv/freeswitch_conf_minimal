Minimal FreeSWITCH configuration
================================

This is a minimalistic FreeSWITCH configuration. It does not do anyting,
yet it allows starting the FreeSWITCH daemon and connecting to its
console with fs_cli.

The purpose of this configuration is to provide a base for new projects,
so that you don't have to clean up the vanilla configuration from
unneeded features.

Tested on Debian with packages from [http://files.freeswitch.org],
FreeSWITCH version 1.2.13 (it should work also with any other FreeSWITCH
version).


Usage if you do everethyng as root:
-----------------------------------
cd /etc
git clone https://github.com/xlab1/freeswitch_conf_minimal.git freeswitch


Usage if you work as multiple non-root users:
---------------------------------------------
echo "umask 0007" >>~/.profile 
umask 0007
sudo adduser jsmith freeswitch
sudo mkdir /etc/freeswitch
sudo chgrp freeswitch /etc/freeswitch
sudo chmod g+ws /etc/freeswitch
cd /etc/freeswitch
git init --shared=0660
git pull https://github.com/xlab1/freeswitch_conf_minimal.git master





Further on, you may want to set up your own project-specific Git
repository and push new changes to it.

The following files are empty and are placed there to keep the XML
preprocessor happy. Feel free to delete them after placing your own XML
files:

directory/stub.xml
ivr_menus/stub.xml
lang/en/ivr/stub.xml
sip_profiles/external/stub.xml
sip_profiles/internal/stub.xml


The SIP profiles are modified to allow multiple domains, as described in
http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Multi-tenant


autoload_configs/local_stream.conf.xml
is modified to match the MOH paths in Debian packages

autoload_configs/logfile.conf.xml
logfile rotation is enabled, debug loglevel is disabled
