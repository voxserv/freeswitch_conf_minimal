      SIP Gateway profiles are expected to define two inbound variables:
      * "domain": will define the domain and domain_name variables in the target context
      *  "target_context": defines the context to which the call would be transferred
      Incoming calls on those SIP gateways would be forwarded accordingly to the
      target context.
